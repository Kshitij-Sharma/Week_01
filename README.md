### Grading
Every lecture will have a short assignment designed to take no longer than 20 minutes. You shouldn't have any homework, it should all be done in class.

You are given full credit as long as you **attempt** the assignment and make a pull request. This counts as your attendance points.  

There may be occasions where there isn't an assignment and we pass around an attendance sheet, so please come to class.
